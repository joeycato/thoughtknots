The premise of the game is simple. Basically it's a retro-style 2D platformer where you must guide your rocket ship (using WASD or arrow keys) through the cavern and negotiate the various obstacles until you reach the end.

I was inspired by Super Meat Boy's difficulty, so I aimed to make this game similarly challenging.

I wrote Space Cavern while spending some of my vacation time learning all I could about HTML5. In the process I spent a lot of time playing around with the Canvas API. This game is a result of that educational pursuit.
