**rxify** was mainly created as an educational tool to guide those ramping up on [Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/) for the first time by presenting an alternative way to visualize and experiment on its asynchronous features. However, some folks may find it useful for other purposes such as general problem-solving or simplifying unit tests.
