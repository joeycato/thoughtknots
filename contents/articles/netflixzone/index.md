A VR prototype created for the HTC Vive that lets you experience Netflix as if it were a vintage video rental store.

Developing this VR demo was more fun that I originally expected. I decided to use *Unity* for the project, since I was already familiar
with C#. It was pretty intuitive getting adjusted to it, so I'll likely revisit it again in the future.

NetflixZone was also featured in the [Netflix Tech Blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/05/netflix-hack-day-spring-2016.html)
