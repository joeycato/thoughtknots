**NPOP** *(Narcos: Plata o Plomo)* was a small game project we created for the *Netflix Autumn 2015 Hack Day* event. For
the coding I decided to build it using [Phaser](http://phaser.io) and [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/).

It was also featured on the company [tech blog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/11/netflix-hack-day-autumn-2015.html)

Special Thanks to my teammates Adnan, Leo and Marco for their help with the level design and assets!
